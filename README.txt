1) Python Programs that make use of binary operators that are used in PA1 but have a different behaviour are:

i) + operator used for string concatenation:
This can be implemented by determining if the value is a number or not. If its not a number then take it as a string and concatenate them.

ii) - operator used for set subtraction.
This can be done the same way as the above one.Determine the type of the value and if its not a number as is an array or set, then just delete the elements of the second array present in the first array.

iii) max and min operators can take in muliple parameters other than 2.
This can be done by allowing more than 2 operands for such kind of operations

2) TA Videos were very helpful in understanding and submitting the code

3) Did not collaborate with anyone.
